# DevFlix

Greetings from the SSN Tech Club! We bring to you a beginner-friendly Web Devlopment workshop with a highly practical, hands-on approach to coding pages that are interactive.

Netflix has secured its spot as binge central. But have you wondered how it works? Learn to develop a responsive website with Tech Club as we teach you how to recreate Netflix's homepage. We'll start right from the basics of HTML and CSS and build up to responsive websites, so don't worry if you have no prior experience! The session will happen at 6pm on 23rd January.
